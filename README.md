### Reflection of this course
As a student, studying integrity and anti-corruption has made clear how important it is for individual ideals to influence a society's moral code. It has come to my attention that integrity requires a constant adherence to moral ideals and honesty, which goes beyond simply following the regulations. On the other hand, the foundation of justice and trust in any community is threatened by corruption. This scholarly investigation has increased my consciousness of the personal obligation to cultivate an open and accountable culture. It inspires me to work hard as a student to create a culture in which moral behavior is valued and upheld as a shared commitment.
